    Tailwind Docs implementation for nextjs
    https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
    Files created:

+ does animxyz work with d3 and tailwind css?
    https://animxyz.com/docs#react-installation
    It should work fine because it uses a custom xyz property rather than className

    schema.gql file - simple graphql schema
    https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-fauna/schema.gql
    fauna.js file - makes queries to faunadb
    https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-fauna/lib/fauna.js
    index.js file for the api
    https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-fauna/pages/api/entries/index.js
    It turns out that I don't actually need a big complex backend framework like django... yet.
- what are all the custom types that you'll need
    according to the example, I only really need a types folder at the top level

    Consider React Query as well as the vanilla React library components.
    Even before considering a state manager, it's probably best to define exactly what state I'm trying to track.
    - define what kinds of state you'll be managing
