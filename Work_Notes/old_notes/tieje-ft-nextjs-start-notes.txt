        It's best that I don't start with an example.
        Bootstrapping with an example helps me get started at the cost of tech debt: I won't be sure how this works.
        It's best to simply study the code on my own and then implement it on my own.

        NPM is a package manager, you can install node.js packages using NPM
        NPX is a tool to execute node.js packages.
        npM - Manager
