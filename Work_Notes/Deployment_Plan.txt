Guidelines:
Build a script for building up and tearing down your build. I CANNOT run all these commands by hand again.
I only need to create the production environment. My dev environment is only my mac so it's fine.
I have decided that I'll perform development on my mac. If I run out of space, that's just too bad.

I'm going to need to build a really good docker command
I can use buildx within a Dockerfile:
https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/
Docker bake is not ready yet, which means I can't use buildx in Dockerfile yet.
But what I CAN do is build a general-purpose image and then use that image for development.
If this is the case, then I will need two kinds of docker-compose and Dockerfile files:
One set for my local dev environment and one set for the production environment.


Prerequisites
+ Build or find a general-purpose raspberry pi environment (linux/arm/v7)
+ hook up the postgreSQL db to django

- Dockerize your application
    - create backend Dockerfile
        - use environment variables in .env files
    - create frontend Dockerfile
    - create docker-compose.yml file
    - build and push to Dockerhub with docker
        docker buildx build --platform linux/arm/v7 -t tieje/skilltree_backend:latest --push ./Backend
        docker buildx build --platform linux/arm/v7 -t tieje/skilltree_frontend:latest --push ./Frontend

- Deploy from Docker Swarm
    - SSL certification and renewal
