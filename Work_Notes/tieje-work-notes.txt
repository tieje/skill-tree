I might use the react testing library. Well, I want to use the react testing library.
It's still very early on. I'm pretty sure I know what I want to do and it is fairly simple... I think.
https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/
Do I need to make tests fo this application? Is it even big enough.
Well it probably is... I'll learn it at the very end. I don't think it will help yet.

+ make a unique ID for every hexagon
    The unique ID should be its position in the hexgrid.
    I actually don't need to create a unique id for every hexagon.
    I thought that I might need to create a unique id for every hexagon because I would be using path to refer to their position.
    If I'm going to add a IDs to the hexagons, I'm going to either use a pull request or fork it myself...
    Fortunately, I can use class instead. The pathfinding example pretty much has what I want. I won't need to fork it.
    the unique classes are of the form of:
    hexagon-group 18,3,-21
    This is how it's done in the pathfinding example:
    https://github.com/Hellenic/react-hexgrid/blob/master/examples/pathfinding/src/App.js
    It may be a good idea to implement its cursor-finder as well.
+ create a custom initial zoom
    For the custom initial zoom, I'm going to need to determine where I can get this from panZoom...
    I certainly will not be using the fitToView functionf for this one.
    https://github.com/chrvadala/react-svg-pan-zoom
    I'll need to change the useEffect function...
    https://github.com/chrvadala/react-svg-pan-zoom/blob/main/docs/documentation.md#methods
    zoomOnViewerCenter(scaleFactor) - This is function I'll need.
    It works but it's focusing on the true center of the window instead of the SVG...
    It's assuming the SVG is rendered in the center of the window.
    I'll try moving the SVG to the center of the window with Tailwind?
    Or do I use fitToViewer in combination with zoomOnViewerCenter?
    perhaps I'll just use the normal zoom() function instead
    - Unfortunately, for smaller screens, it will start slightly to the left, which is not the worst thing.
+ bind v key for pointer
+ bind h key for hand scrolling
    onKeyPress is for the input text field
    This was insightful.
    https://www.querythreads.com/listen-to-keypress-for-document-in-reactjs/
    I may use this package though:
    https://github.com/donavon/use-event-listener
    The actual code was a bit confusing, but looking at the example allowed me to figure out how to accomplish tool changes.
    https://github.com/chrvadala/react-svg-pan-zoom/blob/main/examples/controlled-component/src/App.js
+ install tailwind
+ Wrote an article on what I did in the past about searching for the right library.

    It's a bit... difficult. I'll need to do this later.
+ get cute pencil and office stationary wall-paper background
+ add a tool tip for image link
+ create static instructor interface
    + Create static sidebar on the left. It must have:
        + title input
        + lesson text input
        + feedback checkboxes
            + quantitative
            + verbal

                no need yet
+ Write an article about binding keys to actions using the hook module and refer to the link that you found
x create stateful instructor interface with json served by graphQL
    I *can* do it. But I built the backend exactly how I want it AND I know how to update it so... I don't really need graphQL.

I'll just use React Query instead of Axios. If I did use Axios, I would need to create my own promise and async await functions.

Node Module Design
Node text or node image, never both. If no node image, then the title will be used with ellipses in the hexagon.
Look into React query.
I'm going to need a state manager... Probably something like Redux.
State that I need to manage:
    - Drag mode vs pointer mode
        - Within Pointer mode: Path creation mode:
            While in pointer mode, paths can be created
            Path Creation shortcut should probably be the "k" key
            - Starting hexagon
            - ending hexagon
            - Paths can only be deleted and created, not updated
    - pointer mode
        - clicking on the node grabs note data for that node
            Only the owner will have edit buttons for editing
        - edit button changes the state of that component to edit mode
    - theme
Redux middleware: this is going to be useful for whenever I need to update the API
https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/presentations/react-redux-ts-intro-2020-12/#/61
Great graphic for what it means for me:

Make sidebar stateful

+ breakdown the sidebar into components
+ try using Redux to manage pointer mode and drag mode
+ sidebar must disappear while in drag mode and appear while in pointer mode
    So actually, There are two kinds of modes: keyboard shortcuts change visibility and dragging while one-screen buttons change only dragging.
    This bug is now a feature. I need to make sure I don't reproduce this in other features

Use an existing skill tree
Some logic like verbal, quantitative feedback will be updated frequently.
I won't be using RTK Query because it's meant to be used with createAPI. I already have an API.
It turns out that a lot of middleware is actually included by default.
I should focus on createAsyncThunk and createEntityAdapter.
extraReducers are used to respond to other action types beside the types generated.
They are meant to reference external actions.
https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice
extraReducers allows you to respond to an action in your slice reducer but does not create an action creator function
For example, they would be used in responding to a createAsyncThunk action, or perhaps responding to an action from another slice.
I'm actually supposed to use multiple slices - perhaps one slice per each functionality.
x I'm going to wire up slices such that there is an extraReducer function handling the visibility of the sidebar...
    I won't do this because I'm using useEffect already for this and it might get needlessly complicated.
I'll use react query for CRUD functionality... It could actually replace redux because it's a server-state library.
I'll use React Query for making post requests and see how it compares to Redux. I could just axios at this point... but we'll see.
I'll use the second checkbox for comparison.
Testing was successful for React Query. Posting seems simple enough. Updating... is a different matter.
It looks like useState() is used a whole lot for keeping track of and updating local state within the function.
It looks like the way that queryClient actually works is that it saves everything to the cache.
This contrasts from Redux in that redux is functional and pure but storing variables in cache stores state...
I figured out redux, but... well... It might be worth building with React Query instead. Someone who has gone through all of these
libraries says not to learn redux and to just use anything else. It's not that hard.
There's actually a little tidbit about how "React Query is not a replacement for local/client state management."
It even cites cases where I should use a state manager.
https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/does-this-replace-client-state
I've decided that I won't be using React Query because I'm going to need a real state manager for this project.

x Change sidebar visibility logic to react query

3/30/2022

I can't use a normal useQuery because it refreshes too much.
I can't use a hook query because updating re-rendering constantly is pretty bad for the client.
Every time I move anything, setState causes a re-render of the whole thing.
I don't think I actually need RTK Query...
I need to figure out where and when to fetch data in redux.
https://daveceddia.com/where-fetch-data-redux/

3/31/2022
4/1/2022
I need to look at this later.
https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-guide
There are no default paths to generate, but I can keep an object of paths.
    Create new paths state in redux to keep track of >
    Path. In this case, it's probably ok to do play Hex() objects within this state.
    The only problem is creating the object.
I'm running into a problem with RTK query. I'm not using is correctly. I need to redo the slice for everything.
https://www.softkraft.co/how-to-setup-slices-with-redux-toolkit/
There is an "old" way of doing this, and then there is the more streamlined approach.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60290580/how-do-i-make-an-api-call-using-createslice#60325398
It's not really an "old" way, more like a "custom" way to grab data.
Mission accomplished. Paths were successfully applied and state is better managed by redux in the actual component.

    + change backend such that the notes are returned as well with skill trees
    + make it so that only one text input can be edited at a time

4/3/2022

The way that the checkboxes work right now, make it a little complicated to have a shortcut for it.
Well, it's probably for the best that checkboxes don't have shortcuts because they're so easy to mess up and miss.
It feels like I'll need to extend the Hexagon component.

+ checkboxes allow quantitative feedback allow verbal feedback
    x pass functions as props to function react component
    + add checkbox state to store
    + manually testing state changes

I need to save the last hexagon focused to localStorage.
https://dev.to/link2twenty/react-redux-and-localstorage-2lih
https://redux.js.org/api/createstore/
If I were to create a localStorage, it would need to save and define ALL states, not just one state.
Initial testing with Posting data to the API was a success.
I'll need to return the new hex_id from the API every time a POST method is used for skilltreehexagons.

+ make it so that clicking on a hexagon loads that hexagon's sidebar data
    x last hexagon focused should be saved in localStorage
        Do this later and save this to user data instead on the backend instead of localStorage
+ Write an article about the static instructor sidebar interface that you made
    It was more like an update on my progress for this project so far.
    Below was part of the update:
    + modern redux tool kit development
+ Write an articles about to how to safely delete a table in Django (do this on an example different project)

I'll need to return the new hex_id from the API every time a POST method is used for skilltreehexagons.
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/2-requests-and-responses/
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/responses/
https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/mutations
It's better if I invalidate the query and grab again instead of generating a custom response.
https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-8-rtk-query-advanced#invalidating-specific-items
Let's experiment with updating since. If I can figure out how update and invalidations work, maybe I can figure out how to reload for hexagon focused.
I'll perform the update with checkboxes.
https://restfulapi.net/rest-put-vs-post/
I did not understand PUT operation well at all. Supposedly, this operation does what I already need it to do.
If something already exist, then it will update it.
If something does not already exist, then it will create it...
I set up some basic logging in Django.
It turns out the problem with my mutations is that I needed to add a slash to my URL... REALLY?
PATCH is successful, and I'll probably use the PUT method later.
I'll need to rethink my architecture though.
The big question was should I use a GET hook for every piece of the sidebar component?
Or just call it once?
The GET hook should be fine since it's just going to grab it from the cache.
What I'm doing right now is small experiments for seeing what works and what does not.
PATCH method is working as intended.
It looks like every component that re-renders state, WILL need to have their own GET hook.

4/6/2022

Get the PUT method working for checkboxes.
If the hexagon is entirely new, clicking on the hexagon and changing the checkmark will create that hexagon.
The checkbox will re-render, however, the entire SVG element will re-render as well.
I can probably force a re-render by using useEffect to listen to hexagonFocused.
This is becoming needlessly complex.
I think I'll use a separate method of generating hexagons in the backend.
With this, I can have an ID ready instead of needing to create hexagons on the fly.
The initial load might be a lot, but ultimately it will be easier to work with.
Probably the most important thing will be that I can finally use a proper useQuery Hook to update the hex grid.
The useQuery hook will allow for the dynamic creation and update of Paths in the hex grid.
This will work.
The updated skill tree table will have a 256 new rows each labeled with their corresponding hex string.
The input of each row will an unique hex ID for that specific column.
This means that updating with the same hex ID will not be a problem.
Instead of deleting the additional info, I'll just create another skill tree.

+ Update the backend such that each skill tree has 256 unique hexagons the ID will be the appropriate hex string
    + Do NOT delete the Hexagon table
    Form of:
    h_0_1_m1
    where m means "minus sign"

4/8/2022

+ Update the frontend such that the hexgrid is generated from each db column

4/9/2022

You'll need to do two things:
1. Create the new hexagon without invalidating queries.
2. Update the Skill Tree hex string column and then invalidate the skill tree query.
This doesn't work because I don't know what ID to use to update the skill tree.
Instead, I'll need to update the skill tree after query invalidation.

1. Create New Hexagon
2. Skill Tree Query invalidates
3. Skill Tree hexagons are grabbed and processed.
4. If the Hexagon's hex_string matches hexagonFocused.hex_string, update hexagonFocused to be that Hexagon's properties.
    This would include the hex_id.
x Problem: Any hex_id would match the hex_string.
x Solved: useState to set the original hex_strings. If the new hex_string is not in the original hex_strings then change hexagonFocus to that and set new useState.

I don't actually need to update the skill tree.
Only the Hexagons need to be updated... Then invalidate the skill tree.
Later, I can optimize the API by creating a separate table for the base skill tree and then add that to the API with a serializer. Even better, I could preload the data into state if needed.
Either way, it's very important that state comes from one place.

1. Create New Hexagon
2. Skill Tree Query invalidates
3. Skill Tree hexagons are grabbed and processed.
    hexagonFocus does not need to be updated because I can just go by the hex_string
    If the hex_string for hexagonFocus matches the hex_string for an existing Hexagon, then assign hexagonFocus to that hex_id.

+ mutate hexagons data with sidebar

4/11/2022

Paths can only be created and deleted but not edited. This is to simplify the process.
k and an on-screen button will be used for Path Edit mode
    In path edit mode, the left sidebar will be invisible.
    Creation
    Instead of the sidebar, there will be a red sign with a transparent gray background that says "Path Edit Mode"
    Clicking on the first hexagon will highlight that hexagon.
        In the gray area, there will be button called DESELECT.
        Alternatively, the shortcut ctrl + Z will Deselect it as well.
    Clicking on the second hexagon will draw the path.
    Deletion    
    To delete a path, click on any path and either press the DELETE button in the sidebar or the backspace button.
    The gray background will be slightly transparent with red text of PATH EDIT MODE.
    Below path edit mode label, buttons will be listed below and will be disabled until they are needed or possible.
    Shortcuts signs will appear next to the buttons.
The states that will be needed:
    startingHexagon
        State will be cleared if deselect function is used
    endingPathHexagon
    pathEditMode
        Can only be turned on if the edit modes for other states are false.
        Button and shortcuts will appear at the top
        This will actually be a string with preset options.

I'm not sure how I'm going to change styling.
I did it by rendering an additional hexagon from data in the hexagonFocused state. Well that was easy.
Now that the path module is completed, I need look into how to create the accounts module.
Look into your django for REST APIs as well as custom django accounts.
I don't think I'll need a custom django account...
I think I can just create another table for additional info if I really need it.
I need:
    id
    first name
    last name
    email
It seems like W.S. Vincent is using CustomUser from abstract User. We'll see if I should use it, too.

Routes specify attributes "path" and "element".
Link specify attribute "to" which goes to the path specified in "/about". This is pretty simple actually.

Fortunately, my clientside routing is not that complex.

It looks simple.
For now, it will look like:

Honestly, this is getting harder and harder. I wonder if this will take me two weeks.
For now, it will look like:

I'm going to need drag and drop functionality for hexagons...
Teacher > creates account > browses public skill trees for a template > Forks template > Edits template >
wants to share skill tree with students > class creation page > gives list of emails > (optionally can create another class with a name)
Drag and drop classes on the left side into the left container AND drag and drop skill trees on the right side into the right container. >
Create Cohort and Send Emails. > Directed to My Cohorts Page organized by Dissolution Date >
At the Dissolution Date 
Skill trees need to be shared privately with a URL... This will be feature for later.
These are all features that I can create later if a school district would like to adopt the system.
It's possible to be made in a way that suits all needs but these are features that I don't need to create for an MVP.

MVP
- all trees
    - are public
    - have up to four tags
    - Option to Make a copy and edit as a teacher
    - to use tree as a student
- instead of sending an email to students, students can search for the skill tree
    Should I do a URL?, an ID?. Perhaps both.
    - Teacher can share a URL made specifically for Students by sending it in an email to students.
    - Can search for public skill trees by the ID number
        I need two methods so that there can be confirmation.
- Skill tree
    ID
        - Just the ID for it
    settings
        - Delete and reset feedback on these dates
        - Theme
        - Skill tree name
        - tags
        - profile picture
    statistics
        - Students's Average feeling of comprehension of topics in Skill tree (Quantitative)
        - Forked
        - Thumbs Up
        - Thumbs Down
        - download statistics as CSV button (feature for later if desired)
Making skill trees public means that anyone can give feedback and that anyone can theoretically take the class.
This is fine because it's an MVP.

Main hub page
    I would like for the initial state to be three boxes in a minimalistic style.
    - search for skill trees
        - copy and edit as teacher
        - Copy link for students
        - use as a student
    - Teacher Skill trees - list of skill trees that you can edit, sorted by date last edited (recency)
        - copy link for students
        - Edit skill tree
    - Student Skill Trees - Skill trees that you're using as a student will be listed, sorted by date last used (recency)
        - Copy link for students
        - Use skill tree as student

Top navbar Middle to Right
Logo (home page)
User Settings

Possible design layouts
    - sidebar list on the left and Skill Tree specifics on the right
        - I wish I knew how to do a mini screenshot just as a preview...
        - I'll need to learn how to do a mini screenshot to serve as a preview
        - search bar in the middle top
        - underneath are tabs: Student | Teacher | Discover
        - underneath tabs is a description of what the tab is for:
            - Student
                - Skill Trees that you are studying
            - Teacher
                - Skill Trees that you own
            - Discover
                - All skill trees. These trees can be copied or you can be a student of it
        - list of skill trees
            - profile picture - won't be needed if I can get a visual preview...
            - label
            - thumbs up
            - thumbs down
            - times copied
        - clicking on the skill tree shows an expanded button list of options?

honestly...
Make all skill trees private. It's just too much work to make them public.
Invite to a skill tree by link only.
Share by screenshot.

Tabs
    Learn
        List of Skill Trees that you're learning from
    Teach
        List of Skill Trees that you're teaching
Lists are ordered by recently viewed.
Copy Figma for design in creating a new skill tree around the top.

I've given this a lot of thought. I have good idea of what I'm going to do now.
Now, I will focus on actually designing and building it.

4/19/2022

With information above, turn this into a mastapiece.
https://www.figma.com/file/2HIVXfIRBTeEJy5QnTphSY/skill-tree?node-id=102%3A2

+ design the tree picking page on Figma
    + desktop
    ~ mobile
        I'm not going to do this since it's pretty simple to translate it to mobile
+ design the home page
    + desktop
        I made a very rough... thing.
    ~ mobile

4/21/2022

I'll have a logo, but it's not going to be in the nav bar because this is a productivity tool where you don't want to
be redirected to the frontpage, not even accidentally.

+ build the static navbar
+ build a static version of the tree picking page

I don't need to redo security because even if they get into the main application,
they can't even use it because you cannot access the data from the api. This is fine.
Today is the day that I do an overhaul of Pan Zoom.
1. Preload state with data in the form of:
0,1,1: {
    hex_q,
    hex_r,
    hex_s,
}
Returning user id with key
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44965908/django-rest-auth-registration-how-to-return-user-id-with-the-key-when-using-tok
I didn't make the treepicker stateful, but I did make much-needed updates on the backend.

+ An underline and a blue text color should only appear for the chosen filter between Learn and Teach
+ update backend to include
    + skill tree table
        + tree picture
        + last_edit_timestamp skill on every update or creation
    + accounts table
        Skill trees already have an owner so it's enough to grab them by owner.
        I would need to create and another serializer for it though. But I'm building this anyways.
        + build another table of user id and skill trees being learned
            + id
            + user id
            + skill tree id
        + in the serializer, you'll want to get a list of skill tree IDs and grab the info for all of them for each kind of relationship
        + grab all skill trees being learned in the user serializer
        serialize the following to get which skill trees are you the owner of
                + grab all skill trees being taught in the user serializer
+ return user ID with Token
+ update the store to grab user_id in preloaded state
+ do an overhaul on the panzoom data. Make sure that the state is preloaded and build on top of that original state.

4/23/2022

+ copy the gray hover state of the create button on figma
+ combine learning and teaching serialization in the backend
+ make Learn and Teach buttons stateful and working as intended

4/24/2022

+ clicking on any skill tree, navigates to the test skill tree

4/25/2022

+ make clicking on the skill tree go to the actual skill tree
+ Skill Trees to trees button for navigation
+ Fix width and height... for now... for ReactSVGPanZoom
+ in App.tsx make it so that the home page navigates to the intended skilltreepicker page
+ make it so that it's possible to create and edit skill trees on different pages
+ test path creation in other skill tree
+ replace useState hooks with Redux in PanZoomHexGrid
+ delete hexagon button at the very bottom
x button for editing global skill tree settings (g button)
+ sign for shortcut for pointer mode and drag mode

4/26/2022

Drag and drop is some major functionality that I'll need to think of...
It's going to need it's own variable...
I might want to create a page state variable since there are essentially three or four page states:
It might not be important to manage page state, if the sidebar disappears while moving a hexagon.
onDragStart
    Have hexagonFocused be this hexagon.
    if the target has a hexagon ID, disallow drag
onDragOver
    Prevent moving hexagons from overwriting one another.
    If the hexagon already has a hex ID, do not allow drop
    https://github.com/Hellenic/react-hexgrid/blob/master/examples/drag-and-drop/src/GameLayout.js
    Line 48
    but I'll want to look into React TypeScript Chapter 1 for a way for the user to see a preview.
    file:///Users/thomasfrancis/Desktop/fullstack-react-with-typescript-book-r11-basic.pdf
    Page 107
onDrop
    Assign hexagonFocused's data to the hexagon dropped on.
    Mutate the hex ID's hex coordinates in the backend
onDragEnd
    Clear the data of the source hexagon
    I don't actually need to do this since onDrop would be enough.

x drag and drop functionality for hexagons
    Drag and drop cannot work because these states are already being used by ReactSVGPanZoom...
    I can't do Drag and drop, but I can move hexagons by clicking.
+ Click Move node functionality for hexagons
x in the sidebar components make it so that clicking on a hexagon where hex_id is undefined, does not grab data for it
    It's not a big deal because the query will be cached

4/27/2022

Make the right column under the navbar...
It might be a better idea to have global settings underneath hex information.

I received a quiz from Deskpass. Let's do this.

4/28/2022

+ completed the deskpass test

4/29/2022

For a teacher and student view, I'm going to need state...
Viewer > The default viewstate should be student.
When Viewer is the owner then it renders.
This means that I don't need viewer state.
All I need to do is to check if the user_id and the user of the skill tree match.
I'll need to create another URL storage for the skill tree profile picture.

+ make it so that dragging on the side does not occur
    It was just one value change sheesh.
+ remove the toolbar since it is no longer useful
+ Delete Node button only shows up only existing hexagons
+ create student 


4/30/2022

I guess development has been slowed down because I'm paying off my tech debt in the process.
It looks like I'll need to use the useQuery once in the main sidebar so that the text input does not re-render twice.
Got a lot done today.

+ Global Settings for the skill tree on the bottom of the left side
+ view as Student button: Student View Button
+ turn off edit shortcuts in Student view
+ have text only appear in Student View
+ Teacher View button
+ if the user_id matches the user of the skill_tree then teacher mode is displayed
+ There must be "Viewer" state to control the viewer mode.
+ turn off all other shortcuts in student view except for drag and pointer mode
+ test the useQuery in TeacherView - It works. Functionality isn't perfect, but it's good enough for my purposes.
+ get the text input and textarea working properly again

5/2/2022

I need to start studying implementation for deployment. Deployment terrifies me.
It was... so hard last time. I learned a lot, but it was really hard.
I should work on planning out deployment every day.

+ replace loading or error in TeacherView with empty version
+ disable buttons while editing

5/3/2022

I think it's time to build a CI pipeline.
I need some kind of product to show what I'm working on.
I'm not sure when the MVP will be complete.
If I build it in public, maybe something good will happen.
It's a free app after all.

I'll probably run a chron job that runs `git pull origin main` every hour.
But that's not exactly how docker works.
#1. Dockerize your application.
#2. Send to Dockerhub
#3. Deploy from docker swarm whenever a new version is released.
I won't need to shutdown Semblance because the server names would be different.

5/5/2022

It would be better though to simply have one nginx file instead of multiple. We'll see.
To test the actual dev environment, I may need to port forward requests from port 80 or 443 to my macbook air to see things work in action.

+ Get down a general procedure of how you'll deploy your application
+ create your own production docker images for raspberry debian environment pi environment - linux/arm/v7 for the frontend and backend
+ check if postgreSQL database is still running
+ use scp command to move json data dump into new database
    scp datadump.json thomasfrancis@192.168.1.35:/home/thomasfrancis
    I actually did NOT need to do this
+ switch from sqlite db to postgreSQL db in django application
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42125730/how-to-manage-py-loaddata-in-django
    python3 manage.py dumpdata --natural-foreign --exclude=auth.permission --exclude=contenttypes --indent=4 > data.json
    https://rasholayemi.medium.com/move-data-from-sqlite-to-postgresql-in-django-5e93a4c4ae42
    python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
    Some constraints were lost so I had to run this in the postgreSQL db
    alter table skilltree_skilltreethemes add constraint theme_unique_char UNIQUE(theme);
    ./manage.py loaddata data.json
+ use .env file for database password, django secret key, and anything else, you'd like to keep secret
+ generate new secret key for django
+ save .env info in lastpass

Portainer and Nginx Proxy manager works!

+ look into this article - keep in mind that there is an entire self-hosted community
    https://noted.lol/what-are-your-most-used-self-hosted-applications/
+ rework your stack based on these new technologies that you've discovered
+ deploy portainer
+ deploy nginx proxy manager
+ practice using reverse proxy to send visual.semblance.us to http://192.168.1.33:8080/

Set STATIC_ROOT setting.
Using WhiteNoise to serve static files in django without nginx.
http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/index.html
Copying entrypoint.sh file. It's pretty good.
I ran into a huge problem with whitenoise. The static files were not being served so I kept getting server 500.
This is ultimately what solved the problem.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53859972/django-whitenoise-500-server-error-in-non-debug-mode

+ add gunicorn for production django
    gunicorn config.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:8000
+ collect static files for the backend
+ create script for setup in the backend
+ gunicorn is working with proper CSS
+ install serve globally and serve build version of frontend locally
+ set up domain name and email on zoho
+ run npm build and install serve
+ create dev Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
+ create prod Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
+ create dev docker-compose.yml file
+ create prod docker-compose.yml file
+ made www, api, and visual subdomains of skyskill point to my IP address

Write an article about:

- the next skill tree update

Github Contributions
- contribute to django - either make sure that populating data automatically does not violate existing SQL rules or go by each row one-by-one manually


CI Tasks:
Referencing my old stuff for CI tasks
https://github.com/tieje/semblance/

- use dc-prod.yml to push out images to dockerhub
    https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/push/
- 

Core Tasks:

- design the left column of the tree picker page
- build the static version of the left column of the tree picker page
- build the stateful version of the tree picker page
- left side column for tree data on tree picker page
- theme field in the backend for tree picker page
- Feature for owners to download their data in a JSON File from tree picker page
- edit skill tree profile picture on skill tree picker page
- add state for theme based on available multiple choice

- get the "Create Skill Tree" Button working
- fix permissions so that only the user can grab what they're learning and what they're teaching
- options for removing skill tree
- build the static form page
- build the awaiting for email confirmation page
- build the 404 page
- build the static version of the home page after you have built the skyrim theme
- Add statistics at the top of the left sidebar

Figma

- create student interface
    - quantitative feedback form
    - verbal feedback form
- create custom themes
    - The first custom theme must be a skyrim skill tree
- create skill tree page to pick which skill tree to use
    you'll probably need to use a search bar for this
- make it so that there is an option for a user to save a copy of a skill tree as their own
- use parallax affect for a stylish home page

Auth

- make it so that code 400 logging in says that the password is wrong

Production

- django static files:
    https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-static-files?utm_campaign=Django%2BNewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Django_Newsletter_126
- for navigation (maybe nginx), make it so that if the user is already logged in, it goes straight to the treepicker page
- get down image uploading and usage so that you don't need to rely on external images
- page 185 in Django for REST APIs
- page 142 django for professionals - account email verification with sendgrid
- send email with skill tree link to a list of students on a textarea form separated by a new-line
    I only do this because domain emails cost money in Google
