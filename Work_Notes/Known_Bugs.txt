Important

- Deployment with React Router will likely fail unless the following is done:

Do Later

- The state resets but the sidebar needs to re-render to reflect these changes.
- fix centering button to be the actual center
- turn off drifting for the svg
- I can optimize the API by creating a separate table for the base skill tree and then add that to the API with a serializer. Even better, I could preload the data into state if needed.

./manage.py spectacular --file schema.yml
