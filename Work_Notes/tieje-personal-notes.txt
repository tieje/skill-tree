Generally, I should always be devoting 2 or 3 hours to studying technology while also designing sites and creating posts.

If you need to add attributes like, for example, className, add it to the a tag, not to the Link tag.

STUDY FOR TWO TO THREE HOURS:

- NextJS
x Cypress
- D3
- FaunaDB

TODO

- Come up with a color schema.
    - I should come up with several color schemas for the UI and leave that choice up to the user.
- Think of how you're going to procedurally create the skill tree.
- Think of how you're going to implement user view-navigation on the skill tree.
- Think of the final visual design of the skill trees. I'm thinking of copying Skyrim.
- Think of node icon defaults
- Think of background image defaults. This will be the background beneath the skill tree.

Potential Features

- Instead of procedurally generating a skill tree, allow teachers to create points on a picture they upload.

I'll need to work on my work schedule a bit better...
I probably could have figured out the problem in 8 hours over 2 days rather than in 12 hours over 1 day.
Working 12 hour days for two or three days and then taking two days off...

Work gets easier to do with each passing day.

Two 12 hour days of work and one day off
24 / 3 = 8 hours of "work" per day

Three 12 hour days of work and one day off
36 / 4 = 9 hours of "work" per day

6 hours of "work" every day
6 hours of "work" per day

Last week:

Four 12 hour days of work and three days off
48 / 7 = ~7 hours of "work" per day

Or even

Five 12 hour days of work and two days off
60 / 7 = ~8.5 hours of "work" per day

I'll do an additional two hours of deep work on deployment from 2-4pm.
Then apply for jobs for like half an hour. Today is just not a good day.

Helpful markdown functions:

def markify(a: str) -> str:
    return(a.lower().replace(' ', '-'))
