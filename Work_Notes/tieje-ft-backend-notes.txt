I'm just going to use django since I'm already familiar with it and it serves my needs.

+ install xcode
+ get homebrew working
    + uninstall homebrew
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
    + install homebrew
        https://www.djangocookbook.com/recipes/django-development-environment-on-apple-m1/
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    + install emacs
    https://macresearch.org/fix-cant-be-opened-because-apple-cannot-check-it-for-malicious-software/
        Ran into apple problem
    I need to reinstall homebrew as arm64
    https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/410825/apple-silicon-port-all-homebrew-packages-under-usr-local-opt-to-opt-homebrew
    I'll need to preface each command with:
    arch -arm64 brew install
    pyenv and asdf aren't working for the newest version of python. Let's 3.9 instead of 3.10.
    None of the python versions are working installation from the python website worked though...
    Well. It worked. Shrug.
x get pyenv working again
    uninstalled pyenv
x install postgresql and openssl with brew
    https://gist.github.com/peter-gy/
    path to pg_config
    /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql//14.2_1/bin/pg_config
    path to openssl
    /usr/local/Cellar/openssl@3/3.0.2/bin/openssl
    add to path
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql//14.2_1/bin/pg_config
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/openssl@3/3.0.2/bin/openssl
x choose your version of python
    I guess it's going to be 3.8.11 because something about the m1 architecture messes it up
    Changing archflag env variable
    export ARCHFLAGS="-arch arm64"
    I'm going to uninstall 3.8.11 as well.

x get pipenv working properly on mac
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67733566/how-to-use-pipenv-on-mac
    https://pypa.github.io/pipx/
    The idea is to use pipx, which isolates packages.
    A good explanation:
    "In pipx, we install the package once and we can use the package anywhere on our system isolated from other virtual environments."
    https://mr-destructive.github.io/techstructive-blog/pipx-intro/
    "It uses its own virtual environment for managing packages and python version."
    Copying what I need from my old semblance Pipfile
    https://github.com/tieje/semblance/blob/staging/Backend/Pipfile
    + pipenv install django
    - pipenv install psycopg2
        https://gist.github.com/peter-gy/0ebe072acb9065944ecb04d95a4c3096
        Ran into SSL module error
        brew install libpq --build-from-source
        export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/lib"
        pipenv install psycopg2-binary
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58280484/ssl-module-in-python-is-not-available-on-osx
        just use brew to install python
    - pipenv install graphene-django djangorestframework django-cors-headers dj-rest-auth django-allauth graphene django-graphiql pyyaml uritemplate drf-yasg gunicorn sendgrid
x look for psycopg2 workarounds on m1 mac
    psycopg3 is still under development

It appears that apple got their shit together and they don't want to rely on 3rd party package managers like homebrew anymore.

Using postgresql with django. This is from the source so this will be useful later:
https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-use-postgresql-django


PostgreSQL will be installed here automatically
/Library/PostgreSQL/14

Run this for homebrew if needed
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

Run this for postgresql
echo 'export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/14/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

uninstall pyenv or asdf or whatever version manager you're using
download the python 3.10.4 installation directly from the python website and run the installation
+ pip3 install pipenv
+ pipenv install django
+ pipenv install psycopg2-binary
+ pipenv install graphene-django djangorestframework django-cors-headers dj-rest-auth django-allauth graphene django-graphiql pyyaml uritemplate drf-yasg gunicorn sendgrid
+ write a brief article on what you just learned

When I think about it... I really should be using developer mode and a production mode.
I'll just use normal json data perhaps then... But actually, I would need to set up graphQL data...
Or I could just set up sample data in the database... And that might be better.

Build out the entire backend

+ in vscode workspace settings change python interpreter to this virtual environment python interpreter
+ django-admin startproject config .
    test with python manage.py runserver
+ python manage.py migrate
+ python manage.py createsuperuser
    test with python manage.py runserver
    go to /admin
+ python manage.py startapp skilltree
+ model data in skilltree
    + skill tree
        + skill tree ID
        x owner ID
            Do later when you add accounts
        + name
        + theme
    + skill tree hexagons
        + skill tree ID
        + hexagon ID
            Hexagons used. A hexagon is used if it contains data
        + allow verbal feedback
        + allow quantitative feedback
        + image address
        + title
        + notes
    + skill tree paths
        + skill tree ID
        + starting hexagon ID
        + ending hexagon ID
+ add to app list in config settings
    + SkillTree
    + djangorestframework
    + drf-yasg
+ register models to admin.py in config
+ add skilltree URL pattern to urls.py in config
+ add serializers for each model in skilltree.serializers
+ add viewsets for each model in skilltree.views
+ add views to urls in skilltree.urls
+ add skilltree urls to config
+ python manage.py makemigrations
+ python manage.py migrate
    + test with python manage.py runserver
+ add localhost 3000 to cors white list
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47228488/django-allowed-hosts-vs-corsdjango-cors-headers
    https://github.com/adamchainz/django-cors-headers
    + add "corsheaders" to installed apps
    + add as high as possible to middleware
        "corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
    + add localhost:3000 to the whitelist
+ test backend access with axios
    + cd skill-tree/frontend
    + npm install axios
    + create simple console.log() function to test data from the backend
    SUCCESS
x add urls on the backend to make it easier to grab data
    FAILURE
+ serialize data that combines everything into one skill tree
    x set up graphene django
        It's a bit tedious. I've simply decided not to do it unless I really need to since I'll need to query data normally anyways.
    + utilize django rest apis to return nested json
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65540356/creating-a-nested-json-from-a-value-in-django-rest-framework
        https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields/#serializermethodfield
        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet
- write an article about how to nest JSON with djangorestframework and serializermethodfield() function
The backend core is complete.
