Important Features to Implement

- Color Blind Mode
- custom initial zoom on the node that was last interacted-with
- page 131 - set up View Level Permissions so that only owners and admins can only read and update their skill tree

Features to Implement

- Path-viewing function
    Not really necessary, but it is cool
- search for node by title for the node - use regex
    It might not be a great idea because the struggle of finding the right node will lead to better memory.
- option to change the color of the path being created
