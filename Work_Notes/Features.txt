Important Features to Implement

Features to Implement

- Path-viewing function
    Not really necessary, but it is cool
- search for node by title for the node - use regex
    It might not be a great idea because the struggle of finding the right node will lead to better memory.
- option to change the color of the path being created
- add "original_owners" later so a list of owners can receive credit for their work?
- create logout page
    originally, I just wanted to redirect users to login page. It's still possible to do that.
