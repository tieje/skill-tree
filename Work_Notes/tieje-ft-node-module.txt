I might use the react testing library. Well, I want to use the react testing library.
It's still very early on. I'm pretty sure I know what I want to do and it is fairly simple... I think.
https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/
Do I need to make tests fo this application? Is it even big enough.
Well it probably is... I'll learn it at the very end. I don't think it will help yet.

+ make a unique ID for every hexagon
    The unique ID should be its position in the hexgrid.
    I actually don't need to create a unique id for every hexagon.
    I thought that I might need to create a unique id for every hexagon because I would be using path to refer to their position.
    If I'm going to add a IDs to the hexagons, I'm going to either use a pull request or fork it myself...
    Fortunately, I can use class instead. The pathfinding example pretty much has what I want. I won't need to fork it.
    the unique classes are of the form of:
    hexagon-group 18,3,-21
    This is how it's done in the pathfinding example:
    https://github.com/Hellenic/react-hexgrid/blob/master/examples/pathfinding/src/App.js
    It may be a good idea to implement its cursor-finder as well.
+ create a custom initial zoom
    For the custom initial zoom, I'm going to need to determine where I can get this from panZoom...
    I certainly will not be using the fitToView functionf for this one.
    https://github.com/chrvadala/react-svg-pan-zoom
    I'll need to change the useEffect function...
    https://github.com/chrvadala/react-svg-pan-zoom/blob/main/docs/documentation.md#methods
    zoomOnViewerCenter(scaleFactor) - This is function I'll need.
    It works but it's focusing on the true center of the window instead of the SVG...
    It's assuming the SVG is rendered in the center of the window.
    I'll try moving the SVG to the center of the window with Tailwind?
    Or do I use fitToViewer in combination with zoomOnViewerCenter?
    perhaps I'll just use the normal zoom() function instead
    - Unfortunately, for smaller screens, it will start slightly to the left, which is not the worst thing.
+ bind v key for pointer
+ bind h key for hand scrolling
    onKeyPress is for the input text field
    This was insightful.
    https://www.querythreads.com/listen-to-keypress-for-document-in-reactjs/
    I may use this package though:
    https://github.com/donavon/use-event-listener
    The actual code was a bit confusing, but looking at the example allowed me to figure out how to accomplish tool changes.
    https://github.com/chrvadala/react-svg-pan-zoom/blob/main/examples/controlled-component/src/App.js
+ install tailwind
+ Wrote an article on what I did in the past about searching for the right library.

Consider buy this svg:
https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/kawaii-school-background-with-cute-education-vector-15321280

- make toolbar bigger for both desktop and mobile.
    It's a bit... difficult. I'll need to do this later.
+ get cute pencil and office stationary wall-paper background
+ add a tool tip for image link
+ create static instructor interface
    + Create static sidebar on the left. It must have:
        + title input
        + lesson text input
        + feedback checkboxes
            + quantitative
            + verbal
        + node picture link input
            x default pics
                no need yet
+ Write an article about binding keys to actions using the hook module and refer to the link that you found
x create stateful instructor interface with json served by graphQL
    I *can* do it. But I built the backend exactly how I want it AND I know how to update it so... I don't really need graphQL.

I'll just use React Query instead of Axios. If I did use Axios, I would need to create my own promise and async await functions.

Node Module Design
Node text or node image, never both. If no node image, then the title will be used with ellipses in the hexagon.
Look into React query.
I'm going to need a state manager... Probably something like Redux.
State that I need to manage:
    - Drag mode vs pointer mode
        - Within Pointer mode: Path creation mode:
            While in pointer mode, paths can be created
            Path Creation shortcut should probably be the "k" key
            - Starting hexagon
            - ending hexagon
            - Paths can only be deleted and created, not updated
    - pointer mode
        - clicking on the node grabs note data for that node
            Only the owner will have edit buttons for editing
        - edit button changes the state of that component to edit mode
    - theme
Redux middleware: this is going to be useful for whenever I need to update the API

Great graphic for what it means for me:

Make sidebar stateful
+ breakdown the sidebar into components
- try using Redux to manage pointer mode and drag mode
- sidebar must disappear while in drag mode
- sidebar must appear while in drag mode
- checkbox allow quantitative feedback
- checkbox allow verbal feedback
- custom initial zoom on the node that was last interacted-with
- search function
- search for node by title for the node - use regex
- Path module - press P button
- CRUD functionality
- Enter mode for drawing paths
- option to change the color of the path being created
- click on one node and then another node to draw a path
- Path-viewing function
- create student interface
    - quantitative feedback form
    - verbal feedback form
- Write an article about the static instructor sidebar interface that you made
- create custom themes
    - The first custom theme must be skyrim skill tree

Accounts
- account set-up form
- account email verification
- send email with skill tree link to a list of students on a form separated by a new-line
