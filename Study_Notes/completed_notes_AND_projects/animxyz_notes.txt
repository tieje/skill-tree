I'm going to attempt to play around with animxyz with TypeScript.

https://animxyz.com/docs#react-installation

I'll be using create-react --typescript template


Create the typescript template:

yarn create react-app animxyz_trial_1 --template typescript

yarn add @animxyz/react

My first goal will be to create the fade in and out transition in the example of the front page.

I want to fade in and out the react svg from the default page.

appearing and disappearing work but the css is not working yet. Will need some more work.

I figured it out. I needed to import @animxyz/core.
It works as intended now. So that's cool.

I'll want to practice with creating a real react component that has a list. The list items will fade out together.

Going over the documentation I think I'm done with going animxyz. It's simple enough and it's fairly easy to implement.

The react router gave me some insight on how url routing changes.
It doesn't really bring you to a new page, rather it just switches to a different react component.
So that's cool.
