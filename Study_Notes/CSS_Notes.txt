Grid and flexbox have their strengths.

Grid is better for exact content placement. It's more of the exacting artistry of a web page.
I'm not a fan of such exactness because it's not adaptive.
It sounds like it's better if you're building CSS with a certain device in mind.

Flexbox is better for content flow. It generally works for all devices and is very flexible.
Flexbox is not fully supported everywhere around the web and does have some bugs.
Other than that, it seems like flexbox may be the default CSS framework for my usage.

Looking into SASS, it's not really worth learning right now.
It adds a layer of possibly unneeded complexity. This complexity is usually needed for large websites.

According to css-tricks, Grid was meant for large scale layouts while flexbox is meant for small-scale layouts.
So... Grid is best used for like the background and flexbox is best used for the foreground components.

Perhaps I should not be using flexbox for the background

I'm trying to figure out how to do website layouts with flexbox.

Perhaps I should be using more html instead of trying rewrite everything as a div element...

Perhaps my problem is not so much with learning how to use css, but rather about learning how to html effectively.
