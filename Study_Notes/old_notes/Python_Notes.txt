Rather than trying to learn advanced python programming topics, I should just read the raw django source code.
This way, not only will I learn more about django, I'll probably learn more advanced python programming techniques.

https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/apps/__init__.py
When you want to import files from the same folder, start with a "."

from .config import AppConfig

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44834/can-someone-explain-all-in-python
__all__ means when "import *" is used, only those modules specified in "__all__" are used.
Users can expect that the names in the __all__ will not change.

One of the classes that are imported is definitely a class called AppConfig

Perhaps I should look at django.contrib.admin first.
Or perhaps I should figure out how to build the search function for the application?

.rpartition("string")
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_rpartition.asp
Returns a tuple that's breaks the string into three elements: before, searched string, and after.

.isidentifier()
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isidentifier.asp
https://www.askpython.com/python/python-identifiers-rules-best-practices
"Python identifiers are user-defined names. They are used to define entities in the python program. We should use proper names to hint the use of the identifier. Follow the rule to “keep it simple and meaningful”.

This is an easy way to ensure that the user names their entities appropriately.
