Django does not support alternative test tools, but it can be done because django has an API for testing.

Python's built-in unit-tests will be the primary testing method.
There some advanced testing topics that I will avoid for now. It's mostly about testing view functions.

Interesting that django has their own testing client.
Since I'm not using django for rendering templates, I have no use for their testing client. Well, not really.

It seems like all the info so far is pushing to studying the django.test module. I guess I'll read that too.

The tests in django very similar to normal unit Tests, therefore, I may want to just read a book about unit testing python.
