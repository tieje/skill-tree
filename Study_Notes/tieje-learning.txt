There are 8 things that I need to study. I'd like to spend one 25 min pomodoro session per day on each of these topics: 4 hours.
I'll do this later in the day when I visit my sibling.

I'll also need to work on the final project. An hour per day should be fine.

So more like 5 hours... per day.

I've decide on using yarn since it was built in mind to combat the weaknesses of npm.
I've thought about using nextjs, but it doesn't fit our website.
