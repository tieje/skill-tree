There are 8 things that I need to study. I'd like to spend one 25 min pomodoro session per day on each of these topics: 4 hours.
I'll do this later in the day when I visit my sibling.

I'll also need to work on the final project. An hour per day should be fine.

So more like 5 hours... per day.

I've decide on using yarn since it was built in mind to combat the weaknesses of npm.
I've thought about using nextjs, but it doesn't fit our website.

... So I've added learning TypeScript, Python, and CSS as well. Altogether, it's 10 topics.
This is 5 hours per day. Sheesh.

I'm thinking...

8am - wake up
8:30am - start studying for 3 hours
11:30am - attend standup
12pm - lunch break and take bear out
1pm - visit sibling
2pm - study for an additional 2 hours
4pm - work on the final project
6pm - eat dinner and chill

If missed any study windows, I'll make them up at night during my night reading.
