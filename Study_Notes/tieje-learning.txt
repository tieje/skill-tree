There are 8 things that I need to study. I'd like to spend one 25 min pomodoro session per day on each of these topics: 4 hours.
I'll do this later in the day when I visit my sibling.

I'll also need to work on the final project. An hour per day should be fine.

So more like 5 hours... per day.

I've decide on using yarn since it was built in mind to combat the weaknesses of npm.
I've thought about using nextjs, but it doesn't fit our website.

... So I've added learning TypeScript, Python, and CSS as well. Altogether, it's 10 topics.
This is 5 hours per day. Sheesh.

I'm thinking...

8am - wake up
8:30am - start studying for 3 hours
11:30am - attend standup
12pm - work out, shower, take bear out, eat
1pm - study for an additional 2 hours
3pm - visit sibling
6pm - eat dinner
9pm - 12am - study or work on any additional things that you didn't get done today.

If missed any study windows, I'll make them up at night during my night reading.

I have 12 things to learn now... Perhaps this is... getting out of hand.

2 before 12pm
4 from 1-3pm
4 from 4:30pm to 6:30pm
2 from 10-11pm

It would be a good idea to create a project that combines a little bit of everything.
Connect the faunadb db to django.
Connect apollo to django.
Show an animated list with animxyz and an example of data nodes with d3.
Actually perform testing with django and react as practice.
Provide pagination through results with react-router.

I'll hold off on it until I figure out other things like d3.


The REST paradigm is no longer needed. The future is graphQL.

This means that I won't need to learn Python or Django.
Instead, I can just focus on TypeScript and nodeJS with graphQL.

The backend would be fairly simple.

I guess I'm going full on TS. Python and Django has been switched to nodeJS and graphQL
And graphQL is pretty easy from what I remember. I might not even need to learn it again.
