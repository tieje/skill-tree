I'm going to follow this guide for now:

yarn create react-app d3_trial_1 --template typescript

It works as intended so far so that's cool.

Learning d3 will be easier if I define what I want to build first.

Each tree will need a maximum amount of nodes allowed to be displayed.

I'll need to figure out this design later.

I found my tutorial for D3. So that's cool.
