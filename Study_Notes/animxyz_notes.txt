I'm going to attempt to play around with animxyz with TypeScript.

https://animxyz.com/docs#react-installation

I'll be using create-react --typescript template


Create the typescript template:

yarn create react-app animxyz_trial_1 --template typescript

10/1/2021

yarn add @animxyz/react

My first goal will be to create the fade in and out transition in the example of the front page.

I want to fade in and out the react svg from the default page.

appearing and disappearing work but the css is not working yet. Will need some more work.
