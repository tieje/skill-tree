I went through the initial tutorial on their website. Not sure if I learned much but I'm on the documentation now.
https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/

Since I'll be using graphql for this project through graphene, I think should be using the graphql driver.

Check these out later.

I ended up signing up to dev.to just to see what's out there.

The code I am most interested:

from django.shortcuts import render,redirect
from django.contrib import messages
from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound
from faunadb import query as q
import pytz
from faunadb.objects import Ref
from faunadb.client import FaunaClient
import hashlib
import datetime

client = FaunaClient(secret="SECRET_KEY")

indexes = client.query(q.paginate(q.indexes()))

user = client.query(q.get(q.match(q.index("users_index"), username)))

I guess this is the typical way to get info from faunadb.

I'll create a django project next to test it out.
