Incentives for Students

    • There's a lot to learn out there. A skill tree can help make learning less overwhelming by visualizing the bigger picture.
    • Students can have a central place to access their teacher's notes.
    • Students are empowered to forge their own educational journey by looking ahead of the lesson plan.
