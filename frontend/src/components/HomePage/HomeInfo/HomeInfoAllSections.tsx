                Incentives for Students

                • There is a lot to learn out there. A skill tree can help make learning less overwhelming by visualizing the bigger picture.
                • Students can have a central place to access their teacher's notes.
                • Students are empowered to forge their own educational journey by looking ahead of the lesson plan.

                Future Features will allow students to:

                • provide quantitative and verbal feedback to teachers to enhance the student-teacher feedback loop.
                • visually keep track of how confident they feel about a subject.
