## Problems Solved
Project skill-tree is a free application that allows users to create, share, and link to existing skill trees. The main problems that skill-tree will solve are the following:

1. Help teachers create a self-paced curriculum for students, as well as keep track of their student's interests and progress.
2. Allow students of all ages to find high quality online resources through educational links and book ISBNs embedded in the skill tree nodes curated by the skill tree author.
3. Make education fun, visually appealing, and decentralized.
4. Solve the "What next?" question through well-trodden learning paths in the form of recommendations.
5. Encourage academic experimentation by putting options to create one's own path first.
6. Passively creating a decentralized method of recording the process of world knowledge acquisition across many people.
7. Decentralize the grading verification process: a system of verified professional graders (teachers, professors, instructors) can log in and grade their student's work. Each node will have an end-product project link to view their project somewhere on the web.
## Motivation
I was presenting example ideas of how to improve the U.S. education system for a school project and I came up with an idea of gamifying knowledge acquisition through skill trees. Months later, I was somehow reminded of this idea this week because I have been teaching my sibling a lot lately. Having gone through a fairly terrible education system, myself, I have thought a lot about improving U.S. education. I'm not a great web developer yet so I think this will be a fun project to work on while I'm in school.
