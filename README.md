# Sky Skill

&emsp; The aim of this application is to make education more student-centered by making it a more fun game to play. To this end, Sky Skill will never be a means to measure student ability. Instead, Sky Skill aims to another avenue for improving the student-teacher feedback loop as well as encouraging students to forge their own educational paths.

## This Project Has Been Put on Hold for the Following Reasons

1. Lack of funds for the project.
2. Wanting to rebuild the app from scratch now that I know how to build better.
3. Re-prioritization on honing my skills with smaller projects.
4. I feel like I have reached diminishing returns in terms of what I can learn from this project.

&emsp; I learned a lot about development from working on this project as a solo developer.
Although the project is incomplete, at the very least, I have an MVP that I can show to potential employers.
I still believe in the core message, so I'd like to come back to this project someday.
